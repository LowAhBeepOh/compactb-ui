make the "Good Morning, Loa" more dynamic, here's examples, but add more too:

Good Morning, Loa (if it's morning)

Good Afternoon, Loa (if it's afternoon)

Good Evening, Loa (if it's evening)

Good Night, Loa (if it's night)

Why aren't you sleeping yet? (if it's midnight, and the user has interacted more than 3 times in less then an hour)

What now? (afternoon, and user has interacted more than 3 times in less then an hour)

Hm? (morning / early, and it's the user's first session in the morning)

Good Weekend, Loa (if it's Saturday or Sunday)

Bad Day, Loa (if it's any day on the 13th at friday)

i drank too much (if it's friday night, in August, October, or November) - also add into the system prompt that "Act a tiny bit drunk by writing some words wrong." if this condition is met

drunk (if it's friday night, in August, October, or November, and the user has interacted more than 3 times in less than an hour) - also add into the system prompt that "Act drunk by writing words wrong, forgetting stuff, and whatever." if this condition is met

i'm compactting it (if it's spesically 18:21 on all days expect Monday) - also make so it ONLY writes "i'm compactting it" for all answers

touch grass (only happens in summer, has a 2.5% of showing, but is garanteed to show after 10 interactions in less than 2 hours)

Back again with this idiot... yeah? (15th interaction for the day)
